[*SparkFun QwiicBus - EndPoint (COM-16988)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/16988)

The SparkFun QwiicBus EndPoint is the fastest and easiest way to extend the range of your I<sup>2</sup>C communication bus. The breakout uses NXP’s PCA9615 IC, which converts the two default I<sup>2</sup>C signals into four differential signals, two for SCL and two for SDA. The differential signals are sent over an Ethernet cable, which attaches to the breakout through the on-board RJ-45 connectors The differential signaling allows the I<sup>2</sup>C signals to reach distances of up to 100ft. while still maintaining their signal integrity! To make it even easier to get your readings, all communication is enacted exclusively via I<sup>2</sup>C, utilizing our handy Qwiic system so no soldering is required to connect it to the rest of your system. However, we still have broken out 0.1"-spaced pins in case you prefer to use a breadboard.

The simplicity of the QwiicBus EndPoint is one of its biggest appeals. Other I<sup>2</sup>C communication methods require packetizing I<sup>2</sup>C communication into another protocol, be it RS-485 or 1-Wire. However, the PCA9615 keeps the I<sup>2</sup>C protocol by utilizing a differential transceiver.

This updated version of the Differential I<sup>2</sup>C Breakout adds two 0.1" spaced pins connected to the unused pair of wires on the RJ-45 connectors so users can easily take advantage of the unused pair for whatever they would like. These pins can be used to provide extra voltage to the EndPoint's partner board, the [QwiicBus MidPoint](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/18000) that allows you to add a drop-in I<sup>2</sup>C to your long-distance differential I<sup>2</sup>C chain wherever you would like.

Whether you need to extend the range of an I2C sensor on an autonomous vehicle plagued with noise from motors or want to create a vast sensor network in your home or office, the QwiicBus EndPoint is a great solution to extend distance and reduce noise susceptibility.
